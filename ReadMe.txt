This "python_stack" repo reflects my Python assignments completed during my time enrolled 
in Coding Dojo's Python course. This Python course is 1 of 3 programming languages included
in Coding Dojo's "Full-Stack" course curriculum (Python, Java & React <aka MERN>). I've 
completed all 3 courses for the 3 programming languages in the Full-Stack.  

The name of this repo (& most of its folders) and its general folder structure was 
determined by the course. The Python classwork is split into 2 sections 
which begins in the Python sub-folder and concludes in the Django sub-folder.
